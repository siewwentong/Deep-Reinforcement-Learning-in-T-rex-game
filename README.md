# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-in-T-rex-game

This project is aimed to train a model to play the Chrome Dino game (also known as T rex game) via deep reinforcement learning. Ever since the first paper that successfully trained a model to learn playing Atari games and can even surpass human experts, many work has been done to replicate this outcome on other games. This project uses DQN to approach the problem of training a model to play Chrome Dino game. A CNN model is designed and will output the predicted value of three actions: run, jump, and duck. The model is trained for 5000 games, the highest score achieved is 358 during training, and 221 during testing.
